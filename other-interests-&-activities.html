										<h1>Other Interests and Activities</h1>
									</header>
									<h2>Sports</h2>
									<h3>Sanda (Chinese Boxing), Volleyball, Running</h3>
									<blockquote>
										My commitment to sports has been integral to building discipline, resilience, and teamwork. Through Chinese boxing (Sanda), I have developed quick reflexes, strategic thinking, and physical stamina. Playing volleyball has enhanced my communication skills and ability to work within a team, while running has instilled in me a strong sense of endurance and mental focus. These experiences have strengthened my ability to face challenges head-on, both physically and mentally.
									</blockquote>

									<h2>Music</h2>
									<h3>Guitarist (8+ Years Experience)</h3>
									<blockquote>
										With over eight years of experience playing the guitar, music remains a core passion of mine. This journey has honed my skills in <strong>improvisation, adaptability, and stage presence</strong>, as well as my ability to perform confidently in front of diverse audiences. I have had the opportunity to play at school concerts, weddings, and now as part of a band at <em>Club'Zik (N7 Music Club)</em>. I actively participate in lunchtime jam sessions with my band and offer guitar lessons to beginner and intermediate players. My commitment to the guitar drives me to keep exploring new genres and techniques, with jazz and rock as my primary inspirations. This passion for creative expression has equipped me with confidence, collaboration skills, and a lifelong dedication to <strong>learning and artistic growth</strong>.

									<h2>Associative and Technical Experiences</h2>

									<h3>Astre & Tolosat - CubeSat Club Member (Thermal subsystem)</h3>
									<blockquote>
										Through my involvement with ISAE-Supaéro’s CubeSat Club, <em>Astre & Tolosat</em>, I have gained hands-on experience with interdisciplinary projects in <strong>nano-satellite design</strong>, deepening my understanding of <strong>aerospace engineering</strong>. This club enables me to collaborate with students from various technical backgrounds, working toward real-world applications of scientific and engineering principles. Projects have also helped develop my <strong>project management, teamwork, and problem-solving skills</strong>, all critical in my field of study and future career in engineering. These experiences provide an excellent foundation in both technical and soft skills essential for high-stakes, collaborative work.

									<h3>7Fault - Game Development Enthusiast</h3>
									<blockquote>
										As a new member of <em>7Fault</em>, I am exploring the creative and technical aspects of <strong>game development</strong> using the <strong>Godot engine</strong>. My work here involves programming, design, and testing, allowing me to develop skills in <strong>logic, creativity, and technical problem-solving</strong>. I am currently working on a game project that I hope to release in my e-portfolio upon completion. This venture not only enhances my coding proficiency but also strengthens my project planning, teamwork, and critical thinking capabilities.
									</blockquote>

									<h3>TVN7 - Film Production and Cinematography</h3>
									<blockquote>
										With a deep appreciation for film and visual storytelling, I am actively involved with <em>TVN7</em>, our school's cinematography association. My role here involves <strong>conceptualizing and producing short films</strong>, which has allowed me to refine skills in <strong>storytelling, editing, and direction</strong>. I enjoy collaborating with fellow cinephiles to bring creative ideas to life. Creating film projects also enhances my attention to detail and my ability to convey complex ideas visually. This experience fuels my passion for visual creativity and communication, skills that are crucial for impactful storytelling in any medium.
